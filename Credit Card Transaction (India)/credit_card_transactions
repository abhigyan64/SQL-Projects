Credit Card Transaction of India

I downloaded the dataset of credit_card_transaction from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analyzing-credit-card-spending-habits-in-india)

I did some modifications while importing the data in SQL Server Management Studio 19. • Change the data type of transaction_date from nvarchar to datetime. • Change the data type of transaction_id from integer to nvarchar. • There are 7 columns in the Credit Card Transaction (transaction_id, city, transaction_date, card_type, exp_type, gender, amount)

I write some basic queries to know about the given dataset and these are my findings- • Date Ranges between - 2013-10-04 (October 2013) and 2015-05-26. (May 2015) • There were 4 types of Card (Silver, Signature, Gold, Platinum) • There were 6 types of Expense Type (Entertainment, Food, Bills, Fuel, Travel, Grocery) • We have data of 986 different cities from India

I solved listed problem related to the given dataset

1- Write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends?

WITH cte1 AS ( SELECT city, sum(amount) AS total_spent from credit_card_transactions GROUP BY city)

,total_amount AS ( SELECT sum(CAST(amount AS BIGINT)) AS total_amount FROM credit_card_transactions)

SELECT TOP 5 *, ROUND((total_spent/total_amount) * 100 ,2) AS percentage_contribution FROM cte1 INNER JOIN total_amount ON 1=1 ORDER BY total_spent DESC

2- Write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type?

WITH cte AS ( SELECT card_type, DATEPART(Year, transaction_date) as yr, DATEPART(Month, transaction_date) as mn, sum(amount) AS total_spent FROM credit_card_transactions GROUP BY card_type, DATEPART(Year, transaction_date), DATEPART(Month, transaction_date) )

SELECT * FROM (SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY card_type ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS rnk FROM cte) a WHERE rnk =1

3- write a query to print the transaction details (all columns from the table) for each card type when it reaches a cumulative of 100000 total spent? (we have 4 rows in the output for each card type)

WITH cte as ( SELECT *, sum(amount) OVER(PARTITION BY card_type ORDER BY transaction_date, transaction_id ASC) AS total_spent FROM credit_card_transactions )

, cte2 AS ( SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY card_type ORDER BY total_spent ASC) AS rnk FROM cte WHERE total_spent > 1000000 )

SELECT transaction_id, card_type, total_spent FROM cte2 WHERE rnk=1

4- Write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type?

WITH cte AS ( SELECT city, card_type, sum(amount) as total_spent FROM credit_card_transactions WHERE card_type = 'Gold' GROUP BY city, card_type )

, cte2 AS ( SELECT sum(amount) as total_amount FROM credit_card_transactions WHERE card_type = 'Gold' )

, cte3 AS( SELECT c1.city, c1.card_type, c1.total_spent, c2.total_amount, (c1.total_spent/c2.total_amount)*100 as contribution FROM cte as c1 INNER JOIN cte2 as c2 ON 1=1 )

, cte4 AS ( SELECT *, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY contribution ) as rnk FROM cte3 )

SELECT city, total_spent, contribution FROM cte4 WHERE rnk =1

5- write a query to print 3 columns: city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type? (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)

WITH cte as ( SELECT city, exp_type, SUM(amount) as spent FROM credit_card_transactions GROUP BY city, exp_type )

, cte2 AS ( SELECT city, exp_type, spent, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY city ORDER BY spent DESC) max_spent, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY city ORDER BY spent) min_spent FROM cte )

SELECT city, MAX(CASE WHEN max_spent = 1 THEN exp_type END) AS highest_expense_type, MAX(CASE WHEN min_spent = 1 THEN exp_type END) AS lowest_expense_type FROM cte2 GROUP BY city

6- write a query to find percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense?

WITH cte AS ( SELECT exp_type,gender, SUM(amount) as spent FROM credit_card_transactions GROUP BY exp_type, gender )

, cte2 AS ( SELECT exp_type, gender, spent, SUM(spent) OVER(PARTITION BY exp_type) as total_spent FROM cte )

SELECT exp_type, gender, ROUND((spent/total_spent) * 100 ,2) AS female_contribution FROM cte2 WHERE gender = 'F'

7- which card and expense type combination saw highest month over month growth in Jan-2014?

WITH cte AS ( SELECT card_type, exp_type, DATEPART(Year, transaction_date) as yr, DATEPART(Month, transaction_date) as mn, sum(amount) AS curr_month_spent FROM credit_card_transactions GROUP BY card_type, exp_type, DATEPART(Year, transaction_date), DATEPART(Month, transaction_date) )

, cte2 AS ( SELECT *, LAG(curr_month_spent,1,0) OVER(PARTITION BY card_type, exp_type ORDER BY yr, mn) prev_month_spent FROM cte )

SELECT TOP 1 *, (curr_month_spent-prev_month_spent ) / prev_month_spent AS mon_growth FROM cte2 WHERE prev_month_spent IS NOT NULL AND yr = 2014 AND mn =1 ORDER BY mon_growth DESC

8- During weekends which city has highest total spend to total no of transactions ratio?

SELECT TOP 1 city, (SUM(amount)/COUNT(transaction_id)) as ratio FROM credit_card_transactions WHERE DATEPART(weekday, transaction_date) IN (1,7) -- WHERE DATENAME(weekday, transaction_date) IN ('Saturday','Sunday') --(Slower that the first where condition as filteration works faster with integer value) GROUP BY city ORDER BY ratio DESC

10- Which city took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city?

WITH cte AS ( SELECT city, transaction_date, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY transaction_date, transaction_id) as rnk FROM credit_card_transactions )

, cte2 AS ( SELECT city, MIN(transaction_date) as first_transaction, MAX(transaction_date) as last_transaction FROM cte WHERE rnk =1 OR rnk=500 GROUP BY city HAVING count(rnk) =2 )

, cte3 AS ( SELECT *, DATEDIFF(day, first_transaction, last_transaction) as number_of_days FROM cte2 )

, cte4 AS ( SELECT *, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY number_of_days) as rnk FROM cte3 )

SELECT * FROM cte4 WHERE rnk =1
